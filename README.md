**TeleFrame** is an open source digital image frame that displays images and videos, which were send to an Telegram Bot.

## !!! IMPORTANT !!!
**To update TeleFrame on a Raspberry PI, an additional parameter is currently required to define the processor architecture: `npm install --arch=$(uname -m)`**

You can write the required environment variable once into your `.profile` to update as usual:
```bash
 [ -z "$npm_config_arch" ] && (echo -e "# npm archive configuration\nexport npm_config_arch=\$(uname -m)" >> ~/.profile)`
```

**Before updating to 2.0.0, please read the release notes of release 2.0.0**

## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Raspberry Pi only!)

*Electron*, the app wrapper around Teleframe, only supports the Raspberry Pi 2/3/4. The Raspberry Pi 0/1 is currently **not** supported.

Note that you will need to install the lastest full version of Raspbian, **don't use the Lite version**.

Execute the following command on your Raspberry Pi to install TeleFrame:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSkywalker92/TeleFrame/master/tools/install_raspberry.sh)"
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version.
2. If you like to use the voice reply feature you need to install sox
3. Install *Electron* globally with `npm install -g electron`.
4. Clone the repository and check out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/LukeSkywalker92/TeleFrame.git`
5. Enter the repository: `cd TeleFrame/`
6. Install and run the app with: `npm install && npm start`

Also note that:

- `npm start` does **not** work via SSH. But you can use `DISPLAY=:0 nohup npm start &` instead. \
  This starts the TeleFrame on the remote display.
- To access toolbar menu when in fullscreen mode, hit `ALT` key.
- To toggle the (web) `Developer Tools` from fullscreen mode, use `CTRL-SHIFT-I` or `ALT` and select `View`.

## Configuration

1. Copy `TeleFrame/config/config.js.example` to `TeleFrame/config/config.js`. \
   **Note:** If you used the installer script. This step is already done for you.

2. Modify your required settings.


The following properties can be configured:

## Whitelist Chats

When you start your TeleFrame and send a "Hi" to the bot it will send you back the current chat id. Paste this id or several of them into the `whitelistChats` config option to only allow only pictures from these ids (eg `[1234567, 89101010]`). Leave empty (`[]`) for no whitelist.

## Using the Touch Bar

To use a touch bar for executing commands instead of the default touch gestures you need to add a touchBar obect to your config.
To open the touch bar, just touch the screen. Do the same to hide it again.
The touchBar object takes the height of the touchbar, optionally the autoHideTimeout and a list of elements that should appear as keys. Availiable elements are:

| **Element**             | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `previousImage`         | Navigate to the previous Image. 																													|
| `nextImage`  						| Navigate to the next Image. 																															|
| `play`         					| Resume slideshow. 																																				|
| `pause` 								| Pause slideshow. 																																					|
| `playPause`  					  | Toggle between play and pause. 																														|
| `record`         				| Record voice reply. 																																			|
| `starImage`        			| Star the active image to prevent it from beeing deleted.                                  |
| `deleteImage`        		| Delete the active an image.                                                               |
| `mute`        					| Mute notification sounds. 																																|
| `shutdown`        			| Shutdown the system. 																																			|
| `reboot`        				| Reboot the system. 																																				|

## Voice Replies using TeleFrame

A very simple way to respond to the images is by using TeleFrame`s voice reply feature. The feature is intended to work like this: Who ever comes by the frame presses a button, speaks their message into the frame, when there is 2 seconds of silence or the maximum time is reached the recording will stop and the telegram bot will send it to the chat where the current image came from.


| **Option**              | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`                   | The keyboardkey to start the voice recording                                              |
| `maxRecordTime`         | How long the recorder will record if there is no silence detected (in milliseconds)       |
| `recordingMessageTitle` | The title of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record                    |
| `recordingPreMessage`   | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record before chat name |
| `recordingPostMessage`  | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame during record after char name  |
| `recordingDone`         | The message of the recording dialog displayed on the frame when recording has finished    |
| `recordingError`        | The error message of the recording dialog displayed when recording has failed             |

## Touchscreen support
* Navigate through the images by touching at the left or right side of your touchscreen.
* Pause and resume the slideshow by touching in the middle of your touchscreen.
* Record a voice message and reply to the shown image by making a long touch in the middle of your touchscreen. The recording starts when you take your finger off.

## Updating

If you want to update your TeleFrame to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your TeleFrame folder and type the following command:

```bash
git pull && npm install
```

If you changed nothing more than the config, this should work without any problems.
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.

## Bot only mode (no GUI)

To run only the bot (without GUI), that saves the recieved images and videos into the folder specified in the config you need to run

```bash
npm run botonly
```
in the TeleFrame folder.
